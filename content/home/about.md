The Australasian Meta-Research and Open Science Meeting is hosted by researchers from a range of disciplines (including psychology, statistics, and ecology) with a shared interest in understanding and addressing challenges to replicability, reproducibility and open science. 

We welcome interested students and researchers to join us for two days of workshops, hackathons, and presentations about a broad range of open science and scientific reform topics, including: pre-registration and Registered Reports; peer review and scientific publishing; using R for analysis; open source experimental programming; meta-research; replicability; improving statistical and scientific inference; diversity in scientific community and practice; and methodological and scientific culture change.

Much of our meeting time will consist of unstructured conversations and workgroups to develop and promote open science practices.
